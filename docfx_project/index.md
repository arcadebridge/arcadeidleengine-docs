After importing the asset, you will see two scenes. `Showcase` scene is all about showing all the features while `Sample Game` scene tries to replicate a typical Arcade Idle game scenario. You can find both of the scenes under the directory below:
> ArcadeIdleEngine/Demo/_Scenes/


You can see how Pickable Collectors, Sellers, Spawners and all other systems work. In the next section, we’ll explain what every script parameter do, so you have better understand overall. If you are still confused, analyze scenes and prefabs to understand how they work. I did my best to simplify as much as possible but because it's an Arcade Idle genre, it gets quite complicated pretty easily.
