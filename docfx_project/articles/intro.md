After importing the package, open the demo scene in 

> HyperCasualPack/Demo/Demo.unity

After that you can see how Pickable Collectors, Sellers, Spawners and all those other systems work. In the next section, we’ll explain what every script parameter do, so you have better understand overall. If you are still confused, you can always check the default versions of the systems in their corresponding prefabs.
